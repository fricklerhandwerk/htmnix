# htmnix

A HTML rendering engine implemented in the Nix module system.

## Wait, what?

Yes indeed! It's the HTML standard implemented all over again, but with Nix modules.

## But why?

Because we always wanted type-safe, correct-by-construction HTML, and we always wanted it in the most painful way.

Also because the Nix language intrudes oneself upon us as a templating engine, and is not that bad at it.
